# VerilogHDL-Designing-systems-on-a-chip

This repository contains VerilogHDL code written as part of the laboratory work of the discipline "Designing systems on a chip", read at the HSE MIEM.


The repository presents the VerilogHDL code, which is segmented by laboratory work. In some labs, there are directories containing testbenches for the written code.
